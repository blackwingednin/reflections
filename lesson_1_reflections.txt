During this lesson
we used diff to highlight
the lines that were
different between two different files.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
having access to different versions of a file can make revert back to earlier versions of 
code a lot easier as well as trouble shooting.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros
choosing good commit positions
doesnt get two clutered
cons
you may forget to commit changes
may do it inefficiently
